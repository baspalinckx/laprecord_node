# Lap Record Angular Back-end

To learn more about MEAN stack development all students had to build a NodeJS RESTfull API coupled to a Mongo and Neo4j database. I decided to build a web app for car enthusiast to share their fastest lap times for others to see. 

## I learned

- How construct a RESTFull API with Node
- How to use MongoDB and Mongoose to presist data
- How graph databases work and when they are usefull with Neo4j
